# Flutter Challenge

Inside of `lib/challenges/` there are two files (`challenge_1.dart` and `challenge_2.dart`) which have errors, or must be refactored. They each contain instructions and a list of requirements that must be completed.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the `challenge_1.dart` and `challenge_2.dart` files should be modified.
