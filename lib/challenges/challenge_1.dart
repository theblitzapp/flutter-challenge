/// This widget has an issue. As it changes in height, it takes up the complete available vertical space.
/// However, this is not what we want. This widget should only take up as much vertical space as its column
/// needs, and should not overflow its container when the size is too small.
///
/// Requiremements:
/// - When this widget is given infinite vertical space, it should fit its height to the size of its content.
/// - When this widget is given too little space, such that its contents take up more vertical space than it
///   is given, it should clip its children rather than overflow.
/// - The `ColoredBox` must not be removed, but may be moved if necessary
/// - The children of the `Column` must not be changed
/// - There must be 16 logical pixels of padding between the edge of the box and the text
/// - The text must remain left-aligned
/// - The width must not be changed
